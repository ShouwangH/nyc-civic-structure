## Summary: What Needs to Be Generated

### City
1. **Mayor's Office** - Hierarchical intra view (Chief of Staff, Deputy Mayors)
2. **City Council** - Hierarchical intra view (Speaker, committees)

### State
1. **Governor's Office** - Hierarchical intra view (Secretary, Chief of Staff, Deputies)
2. **State Assembly** - Hierarchical intra view (Speaker, leadership)
3. **State Senate** - Hierarchical intra view (Majority Leader, leadership)
4. **Appellate Divisions** - Concentric view (4 departments) - optional

### Federal
1. **President's Office (White House)** - Hierarchical intra view (Chief of Staff, senior staff)
2. **U.S. Senate** - Hierarchical intra view (leadership structure)
3. **U.S. House** - Hierarchical intra view (Speaker, leadership)
4. **Federal Court System** - Hierarchical view (circuit/district courts) - optional

### What Already Exists
- All agency/department internal structures (bureaus, divisions, offices)
- Court hierarchy for NY State
- Most inter relationships already in main.json edges

---

## Implementation Notes

1. **Inter views** should reference edges that already exist in main.json or need to be added
2. **Intra views** for existing agencies/departments already exist in {jurisdiction}-intra.json subviews
3. **New intra views** needed for executive/legislative offices (personnel-based hierarchies)
4. **Layout specification** needs to be added to each subview definition:
   - `"layout": { "type": "hierarchical" }` for personnel chains
   - `"layout": { "type": "concentric" }` for parallel divisions
